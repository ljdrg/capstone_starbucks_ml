1.	portfolio.json: Contains offer IDs and metadata about each offer (duration, type, difficulty, reward, and channels).
2.	profile.json: Contains demographic data for each customer (age, gender, income, and membership date).
3.	transcript.json: Contains records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed.

## Baseline Model 
The baseline model for this project is a simple logistic regression model.
